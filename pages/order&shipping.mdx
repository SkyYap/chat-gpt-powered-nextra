"Some says, that WPL shipping box is made to survive WW2, all we know is..." - Some says

"The first thing I want to focus on is what you get when you buy from WPL-RC.com. The quality of the shipping itself. This is a 3 ply heavy duty cardboard that is double wrapped. On the inside everything has its own packages. Wrapped tightly in bubble wrap. Every sensitive piece I received was in perfect working condition. I even stood on top of the box to see and it held my weight!" - Adam Peebles

## High Shipping Fee to Canada

You can now shop from our US Warehouse! 3 days shipping! Click Here!

At present we use only premium shipping Yun Express for all the countries we ship to and it's reliable. Unfortunately our products are large in size, so for airfreight, volumetric weight is being billed instead of the actual weight.

For example the actual weight of D12 is 1.7kg, but shipping company bill us 3.2kg volumetric weight due to the large size. and 3.2kg is to the US and all the other countries, but to Canada, the volumetric weight is billed as 3.8kg.

Other than the volumetric weight difference, it also cost 50% more shipping per kg to Canada in this pandemic. 

Shipping fee charged are the actual shipping cost, we do not make profit on the shipping charges. No one is stupid enough to charge very high shipping fee to deter their customers from making purchases.

We understand the high shipping cost issue to Canada, so we opened the cheaper ePacket option but the outcome is very inconsistent shipping time and often time parcel get rejected and returned to us which cause angry customers as well. Therefore this shipping method has been removed.

We look for alternative from time to time and it's unfortunately still very high for the shipping route to Canada.


Thank you

## My tracking shows delivered but I didn't receive the parcel!?

"Tracking shows delivered but my parcel is nowhere to be seen. Not in front of my door. No one knocks the door/bell. No delivery truck shows up on my cctv"



As we normally advised, the FIRST THING you will need to do is check with your neighbors, from our experience, this has happened multiple times, regardless of which country where the delivery guy delivered it to the wrong house on the same street. And the buyer is able to retrieve the parcel from the neighbor. 



By doing so, there's a high chance that you will be able to find your parcel and start building your WPL RC immediately.
