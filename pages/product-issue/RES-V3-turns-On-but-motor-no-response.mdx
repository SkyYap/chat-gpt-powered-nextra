# RES-V3 turns On but motor no response
 
If you are able to bind RES-V3 but headlight continues to blink, left and round sound signal works, but motor isn't working, it is likely that it is in "low voltage cut" mode

Be sure that,
- battery is fully charged

- you are not using the yellow color Ni-MH 6V
- try 3S 12.6V battery to see if it solves the issue

- detach the motor and supply power directly to it to check if the motor is faulty

Note : RES-V3 works best with 2-3s LiPo battery or good quality Li-Ion battery only
